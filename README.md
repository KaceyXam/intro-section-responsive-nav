# 100 Days of Web Design

## Day 5 - React Js

Today I did another junior level project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). The goal of this project was to recreate the webpage they showed. The page has a navbar with dropdown menus that needs to work on both desktop and mobile. I Solved this by having 2 seperate nav lists, 1 for desktop and 1 for mobile. If I was a better web developer, I probably could have been able to use only one list.

### What is React js

According to npm downloads, React is by far the most popular JavaScript Framework, although technically, it's just a library, since it doen't have many of the major features that you need to build a full website out of the box. There are quite a few meta frameworks built on top of React to make it a full framework, like [Nextjs]() and [Remix]().

### HTML is JS vs JS in HTML

React works by letting you bring your HTML into the JavaScript while something like Vue brings the JavaScript into HTML. I see the benifits of both approaches, but since I have a much better understanding of HTML and how it works, I prefer to bring JavaScript into HTML.

### Will I use React again

Yes. React isn't the fastest framework, nor the easiest to work with, but it is the most popular, so if I want to get a job as a web developer, I'm going to need to get way better at React.
